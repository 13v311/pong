# Pong - Made with Python and Turtle
### Description / Info
- Hello! This is my first repository. This project, as of 9/17/2024, is a simple pong game made with turtle with a few added features.
- These added features include:
  - paddle customization (8 colors, 6 shapes)
  - ball customization (same thing)
  - backgrounds (6 choices not including plain)
---

### Gameplay
- To play, all you have to do is run the code! Instructions will appear on the screen so make sure to follow them correctly.
- As of right now, there are three levels. The third level is impossible to beat but it is something I will fix later as I plan to make many updates to this project when I have the time.
- For the first two levels, you will find that the game is very similar to pong, though maybe a bit finnicky compared to other pong games because this is my first project and it's made with turtle.
    
 ### Contributions
- Unlikely that I will add your contribution permanently to my code but I would at least like to see it if anyone actually does add something to this project lol.
